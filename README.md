# Beat-Mix-Project
Project Overview
In this project, I use to practice to write functions to implement logic for a beat-making music machine. By the end, the project have an application that can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. Also I wrote the functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board. Finally, build the functionality to retrieve and save presets to a server.

In this project, for front-end and back-end JavaScript code practice. Codecademy set up the project structure and taken care of the front-end user interface and the actual audio code. I wrote functions that will be called elsewhere in the code so it can turn the project from a nice interface into an actual functioning app.
